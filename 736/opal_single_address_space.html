<li> <b>Summary </b> </li>
Opal is a single address space operating system, which eliminates the
abstraction of strictly enforced virtual address space. This paper focuses on
the design and implementation of global shared address space and the runtime
environment provided to users.
<p>
<li> <b>Problems</b> </li>
The problems in this paper mainly consist of:
<BR>1.) How to make sharing easier and more flexible? E.g. share the pointers
and file descriptors.
<BR>2.) How to design a single address space without losing protection?
<BR>3.) When given a function module or say user program, how to make it able
to run properly inside this system? The code modules should be linked and
relocated so that it can fit into the correct memory address.
<p>
<li> <b>Contributions </b> </li>
The major contribution in this paper I think is to invoke the notice of using
single address. The idea is quite novel since in such way the sharing and
cooperation will be quite convenient, e.g. to share an object, it is enough to
just pass the pointer to the other side, thus avoiding doing data copy, and
also save the effort to serialize the object. Meanwhile, protection domains are
still enforced by segment based protection mechanism. 
Additionly, the single address space can help refining design patterns, e.g.
the mediator pattern used to improve performance of Boeing's CAD tool. Using
the shared address space, the mediator can avoid doing copy things, and improve
the performance. Another example would be quite obvious: 'Singleton' object for
the system wide use can be implemented now gracefully by checking the fixed
virtual address. But in previous system this is not an apparent truth.
<p>
<li> <b>Flaws </b> </li>
<BR>The first thing is the fragmentation problem. This is the common problem
for the segmentation based memory management. But in Opal, this is even worse.
The fact is, when a module not longer exists, its place might not be reclaimed,
but instead left as a hole there. Next time a new module linked in can
manipulate that. However, the new module might not fit exactly into the address
range, and leaving external fragments. I doubt malicious users, if not
explicitly restricted, may have chance to make DoS attack, by creating many
holes inside the address space.
<BR>The second thing is linking. Only when the module comes to the system,
it can know how get relocated, by modifying its instruction addressing and
resolving external symbols. Again, this process is not easy. One reason is
the existence of indirect jump. For example, when the compiler translates a
switch-case, it might make it a jump table. Then the problem comes: All the
addresses inside the table must be modified in order to jump to the correct
place, but how do the Opal knows the size of this jump table without special
hint?
<p>
<li> <b>Extra Question: how does the security of a system change if you have
a single address space?</b> </li>
The biggest change is the assumption changes. In this model, the cross domain
reference is assumed to happen, while in previous address space model, it is
assumed not to happen implicitly.
Moreover, staying one address space gives the attacker more information about
the targets, i.e. on previous system, it is not easy for one to communicate with
another task, but on a single address space system, this may be found out by
probing the exported interfaces: probing can fail, but it is a possible
approach. Once a hacker finds out some way to interact with the target, then
he can start to look for the back doors or weakness, and try to compromise the
target. So the chance to get compromised increases in single address space.
