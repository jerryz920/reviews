Title: Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System
Reviewer: Yan Zhai

1. Summary
 A classic paper talks about event order and clocks. It first mentions
 the logical clock, then gives out an algorithm to cope with total ordering.
 At last it shows something about a mystery physical clock, which I don't
 quite understand.

2. Things I like
 This is the fundamental for the distributed systems. Due to the fact
 synchronized time is not possible in physics, there must be some way to
 determine the orders of the events. In this paper, what it states have
 been widely accepted, like the logical clock and partial orders. Things
 are also quite interesting for authors to mention the physical clock.
 But it in fact reveals the uncertainty of the distributed system, since
 there can be arbitrary failures during the system is running, thus 
 make total ordering impossible. Proof is difficult for me, so I skipped
 the appendix.

3. Question to ask
 What kind of systems use Lamport Clock or its variance? 

4. Question to answer
 4.1 In a distributed system, if event A and event B are both concurrent with
 event C, can we guarantee that event A is concurrent with event B?
 No. If the process where C resides never communicates with A and B residing
 processes, then any order for A and B is possible.

 4.2 Suppose we use the logical clock defined by Lamport. If two events from
 two processes have exactly the same logical time, can we guarantee that these
 two events are concurrent?
 Yes. Due to the clock condition, if a->b or b->a, then C(a) and C(b) will also
 have the similar order relationship.
